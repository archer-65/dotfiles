# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Import additional configuration files
#
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
#import:
#  - /path/to/alacritty.yml

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
#env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  #TERM: alacritty

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Number of lines/columns (not pixels) in the terminal. The number of columns
  # must be at least `2`, while using a value of `0` for columns and lines will
  # fall back to the window manager's recommended size.
  #dimensions:
  #  columns: 0
  #  lines: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 20
    y: 20

  # Spread additional padding evenly around the terminal content.
  dynamic_padding: false

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #

  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:
  #   - Windowed
  #   - Maximized
  #   - Fullscreen
  #

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.
  # Specifying '0' will disable scrolling.

  # Scrolling distance multiplier.
  multiplier: 3

# Font configuration
# The `style` can be specified to pick a specific face.
font:
  # Normal (roman) font face

  # Italic font face
  italic:
    family: VictorMono Nerd Font
    style: Italic

  # Point size
  size: 18.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. `offset.y` can be thought
  # of as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter
  # spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increasing `x` moves the glyph to the
  # right, increasing `y` moves the glyph upward.

    x: 0
    y: 0

# If `true`, bold text is drawn using the bright color variants.
